# Progress Tracker — Loom

Last updated: 2026-04-08

## Current Task
All non-WSL Loom work is complete locally. Parallel demo work under `demo/` is now a validated static marketing prototype with 3 interactive slides (Agentic IDE, AUTOSAR workflow, Knowledge Foundation graph). KPI claims have been validated with benchmarking (`loom/evals/kpi_eval.py`), and USP comparison section added with real GraphRAG metrics.
Recent additions: trace_knowledge.py CLI tool for debuggable retrieval, updated comparison cards with defensible claims (100% Traceable, Relationship-Aware Retrieval).
Next focus: finalize demo for Vercel deployment, validate Windows WSL2 runtime.

## Status
- Research: COMPLETE — `research/agentic_memory_architecture_2026.md`
- Design decisions doc: ACTIVE source of why — `research/loom_system_design_decisions.md`
- Steering: `loom-core.md` ACTIVE, `loom-progress.md` ACTIVE
- Requirements: UPDATED — reflects two curated seed sources, Graphiti as required, and spec-session workflow
- Design doc: UPDATED — rewritten using `requirements.md` as source of truth; includes verified Graphiti adapter appendix

- FalkorDB client layer: IMPLEMENTED — connection management, retries, graph selection, query helper, and health checks are now in `loom/graph/client.py`
- Graphiti adapter layer: IMPLEMENTED — production adapter now includes Azure compatibility wrapper plus latest-API search compatibility (`group_ids` on Graphiti 0.28.2, legacy fallback retained)
- Graph schema bootstrap: IMPLEMENTED — idempotent schema bootstrap routines now enforce unique `id` constraints across domain/audit labels and align `TextChunk.embedding` to 384-d imported vectors
- Curated-source scanner foundation: IMPLEMENTED — SQLite scan/profiling and seed report scaffolding now exist for `ASAMKnowledgeDB` and `autosar-fusion` in `loom/migration/`
- Schema blocker: RESOLVED — switched bootstrap from Cypher-only constraint syntax to native FalkorDB graph APIs (`create_node_unique_constraint`, vector index helpers), validated live
- Deterministic migration foundation: IMPLEMENTED — `loom/migration/deterministic_migration.py` now provides complete curated-table coverage, canonical field normalization, semantic anchor edges, and provenance links through source document and source pipeline
- Loom admin migration APIs: IMPLEMENTED — added `/admin/migration/structured/plan` and `/admin/migration/structured/run` endpoints
- MigrationRun + AuditEvent model: IMPLEMENTED — each structured migration now writes run metadata and per-table audit events to FalkorDB

- Baseline CMM integration: IMPLEMENTED — orchestrator can invoke `codebase-memory-mcp` via CLI bridge, expose direct code-query flows, and surface CMM availability/index warnings; Dockerized orchestrator now reports explicit `cmm_host_native_only` guidance because container packaging still does not include a Linux-ready binary/index state
- FastMCP entrypoint: IMPLEMENTED — `loom/orchestrator/mcp_server.py` now exposes the orchestrator over stdio/MCP with direct ask, knowledge, code, resume, and spec-session tools
- Graphiti live benchmark: IMPLEMENTED — Azure GPT-5.4 mini with `2025-03-01-preview` plus local MiniLM embedder fallback now runs sequential `add_episode` benchmarks (~52s total latest run) and focused temporal smoke checks; Loom now accepts sequential provider-backed ingestion as the supported Azure path while full `add_episode_bulk` remains upstream-incompatible
- Graphiti temporal smoke: IMPLEMENTED — provider-backed `retrieve_episodes` and `graphiti_search` were validated on a fresh temporal benchmark group

- Time-sliced query API: IMPLEMENTED — `/api/v1/temporal/query` resolves active state by valid/transaction time
- GraphRAG baseline: IMPLEMENTED — retrieval pipeline now combines cached community search, local graph matches, vector `TextChunk` retrieval, MMR reranking, and evidence-chain assembly
- Community summaries: IMPLEMENTED — Leiden communities now persist to Graphiti-native `:Community` nodes in FalkorDB, with `loom/artifacts/community_cache.json` retained as backup/export artifact
- Source-pipeline provenance layer: COMPLETE — `SourcePipeline`, `EXTRACTED_BY`, `BELONGS_TO`, and `PROVENANCE` edges are now populated live
- Section 3 (ASAM migration): COMPLETE — structured + reference + audit + vector imports are now live, with reconciliation validated at zero delta for mapped tables
- Foundational test coverage: EXPANDED — client, adapter, schema/bootstrap, deterministic migration, provenance, temporal, retrieval, service API, orchestrator, MCP entrypoint, artifact lineage, ingestion, scanner, identity, and vector-import helpers are covered by unit tests (`52` passing)
- Property-based test baseline: IMPLEMENTED — Hypothesis coverage now validates stable IDs, chunking bounds, routing, and reranker invariants (`4` property tests passing)

- Phase 2 continuity layer: COMPLETE — `project_id` propagates through HTTP/MCP and downstream services, transcript references are retained alongside structured memories, and `resume` returns a token-budgeted prioritized session snapshot
- AMS evaluation suite: IMPLEMENTED — `loom/evals/ams_eval.py` validates project-id propagation, transcript-reference capture, budgeted resume sections, compact seeding, and continuity recall (`all checks passed`)
- Correction queue and practical notes: IMPLEMENTED — graph-backed `CorrectionItem` review flows, `PracticalNote` creation/retrieval, federation export, and provenance wiring are now live
- AMS-to-Loom promotion: IMPLEMENTED — orchestrator HTTP/MCP promotion flows now convert AMS recall output into correction-queue submissions for admin review
- Expanded CMM workflows: IMPLEMENTED — `detect_changes` is now exposed through orchestrator HTTP/MCP and included in coding-task workflows when repo-change impact is relevant
- Deployment packaging: IMPLEMENTED — `.env.azure.example`, `docker-compose.azure.yml`, and deployment/operations runbooks now define the Azure-oriented handoff path
- Production auth hardening: IMPLEMENTED — `LOOM_DEPLOYMENT_ENV`, `LOOM_ALLOW_LOCAL_DEV_BYPASS`, and fail-closed auth behavior now support production-style runs without local bypass

- Phase 1 local validation rerun: COMPLETE — the full non-WSL stack now passes Docker integration, retrieval/spec-session/AMS evals, and load validation; checkpoint `14.5` remains open only for Windows WSL2
- Central AI runtime config: IMPLEMENTED — `.kiro/runtime/ai-runtime.env` now centralizes Azure GPT, Azure embeddings, Azure router, and Hindsight runtime settings
- Demo prototype: UPDATED — `demo/` now contains a validated static Loom marketing/demo page with a 3-slide carousel (4th slide hidden), animated Knowledge Foundation graph scene, rebuilt IDE demos for ETAS ETK / XCP / A2L and AUTOSAR Classic workflows. Product naming: "FalkorDB" -> "Knowledge Foundation", "Hindsight" -> "AMS System". Problem/solution carousel with 7 engineer pain points. Comparison section added with 3 USP cards validated against real benchmarks
- Demo KPIs: VALIDATED — `loom/evals/kpi_eval.py` benchmarks retrieval speed (5.7x vs SQLite, 1.8x vs Chroma) and token efficiency (81% reduction vs raw chunks); results exported to `loom/artifacts/kpi_eval_results.json`

- Local persistence root-cause fixed: COMPLETE — FalkorDB volume now mounts to `/var/lib/falkordb/data`, and append-only persistence survives restart for new writes
- Foundational tests: IMPLEMENTED — unit tests for schema bootstrap skip behavior and curated-source scanner profile loading now exist in `loom/tests/`
- CMM evaluation: COMPLETE — complementary tool, not a replacement
- AMS landscape scan: COMPLETE — Hindsight top candidate

## Architecture (Decided)
- Loom is an internal product for standards research, spec-session authoring, and development execution.
- Core modules:
  1. Loom (FalkorDB + Graphiti) — centralized ASAM/AUTOSAR knowledge graph
  2. AMS Solver (Hindsight or alt) — local per-engineer session memory
  3. LangGraph Orchestrator — single MCP entry point and workflow enforcement
  4. CMM (codebase-memory-mcp) — code structure awareness bolt-on
- Phase 1 seed migration uses two curated fused source systems:
  - `tools/ASAMKnowledgeDB`
  - `tools/autosar-fusion`
- Preserve upstream provenance from `mistral_azrouter`, `docling_kimi25`, `virtualECU_text_ingestion`, and `cleanup_fix`
- Supplementary raw docs remain future ingestion scope, not part of the seed migration
- Spec-session artifact generation and lineage are first-class design requirements
- Seed migration remains deterministic for curated structured data; bulk vector stores stay separate from Graphiti episode extraction

## Build Phases
- Phase 1: foundation, FalkorDB + Graphiti migration, retrieval, orchestrator, baseline CMM, spec-session workflows
- Phase 2: AMS integration (Hindsight) + session/objective/transcript continuity
- Phase 3: correction queue + practical notes + AMS→Loom promotion + expanded CMM workflows
- Phase 4: Azure deployment + federation + scaling + operational hardening

## Key Decisions
- Creator: Jerry Chen (chj1ana)
- FalkorDB over Neo4j
- Graphiti is required, not optional
- LangGraph is Phase 1, not Phase 3
- AMS uses existing open-source (Hindsight preferred), not built from scratch
- Engineers primarily on Windows; Docker/WSL2 must be tested early
- Loom is the internal product going forward, not just a bootstrap project
- Spec-session support is first-class: Loom should help produce and maintain `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`
- Correction queue and practical-notes layer are now implemented for shared operational knowledge capture and admin-reviewed promotion
- Offline mode: DEFERRED
- Local development auth for FalkorDB is still intentionally disabled; credential hardening remains a later task

## Existing Data (Phase 1 Seed Sources)
- `tools/ASAMKnowledgeDB` — final ASAM fused SQLite + vector source
- `tools/autosar-fusion` — final AUTOSAR fused SQLite + vector source
- Raw supplementary AUTOSAR and other source files can be ingested later through the incremental pipeline

## Blockers
- Windows Docker (WSL2) validation is still pending, so checkpoint `14.5` is only locally satisfied today

## Next Steps
1. Polish `demo/` copy, branding, and presentation details before public presentation or Vercel preview handoff
2. Run the documented deployment method with real deployment secrets and infrastructure-specific values when you are ready to publish beyond local development
3. Decide whether checkpoint `14.5` is acceptable as local-complete pending WSL2, or leave Phase 1 formally open until Windows validation is run
4. If containerized CMM becomes a requirement, package a Linux binary plus repo/index state instead of relying on the host-native CLI
5. Monitor upstream Graphiti `add_episode_bulk` Azure GPT-5 compatibility, but keep sequential `add_episode` as the supported path
6. Optionally tighten retrieval quality so more domain prompts resolve without search fallback heuristics
